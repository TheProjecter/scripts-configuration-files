I'm trying this to see if it's better than converting all of my configuration and shell scripts to the .txt extension in order to upload and edit them in google docs.

However, in doing, I think this is a great way to backup my configs/scripts online, share them, and also get feed back from the scene.  If I'm doing something wrong or if you have a suggestion, I'm more than happy to accept what you have to write.  I'm not a guru, but I know what I know, and enjoy figuring out more.  Getting the most out of these machines we've freed by giving M$ "the ol' heave ho" is great, but there's more to this than that.  Scripting, configurations, innovations, efficiency, a sense of accomplishment -- personal accomplishment unique to my life: this is what true computing is, and using Linux you want to stockpile your accumulated goodies.  I'm stockpiling them here.

If you want to add some scripts and configurations to this project or even documentation, contact me.
